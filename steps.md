STEPS FOR DEPLOYING A WORDPRESS WEBSITE TO AN EC2 AND RDS
1. Create an EC2 instance by choosing an AMI that can work with Wordpress and launch an EC2 instance using the AMI
2. I Installed Apache on the instance
3. I launched an RDS instance by using MySQL as my database engine
4. I installed Wordpress on the EC2 instance and configured it to connect to the RDS instance using my database credentials
5. I updated my DNS settings 
6. I tested my Wordpress websight using my IP address to check if it is successfully deployed
